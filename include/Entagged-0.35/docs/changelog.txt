	Version History
		V0.21 ??/??/2005
			Description:
				Maintenance release
			Features:
				Audioformats: Introduced AudioFileModificationListener for global handling of file changes.
			So now one can alter an audio file before its actually modified, or just after it has been modified.
			Because of that the AudioFileIO's and AudioFileWriter's "delete" methods need AudioFile instances
			instead of simple java.io.File instances.
				Entagged now allows the preservation of the file modification time.
				When the new renaming was released, the track number extension was lost, since that was noticed
			by users, its reimplemented as an option.
				The tageditor now supports automatic refresh of the folder content table (activate in "General Options).
				Add a new transformtion: capitalize first letter only
				Comment fields are written with the language code of the current installation. So on non
			english systems the the windows property page and WMP should display the comment text for ID3V2.
			An already existing comment field will be replaced. If there are more comment fields, the
			first one (random) will be replaced. If one of them is already in the systems language, it will
			be handled as the top field (first field) and will be modified.
			Bugfixes:
				Use UTF-16LE by default when using UTF16, or WMP looses his pants

			Description:
				There it is ! many GUI improvements, still very far from perfect !

				This version should really be useable by anyone. I have to fix the hardcoded c:\ drive for the tree root so one can access other drives... I have also to make a better Dialog for the FIle renaming to use the full potential of the module i have written (renaming from tag and tagginf from filename, all with custom patterns...)

		V0.01 31/08/2003
			Description:
				This is the First working version.: you can save and read id3v1 and id3v2 tags (but i don't recommend doing it with sensitive mp3 :), You can also make a freedb query and write one of the results, but not change it...
			Features:
				Saving raw informations gathered with freedb (no changes are allowed for now)
				Saving/Reading id3v1 and id3v2 tags file per file or on multiple selection
			Bugfixes:
				Diplay of the time format now its ##:## with zeroes if needed
				Comment in ID3v2 are now saved correctly, with the eng\u0000 langage
				Comment in id3v1 is now working properly, even with freedb and uses a combobox
			To Do:
				For the moment, the main things I plan to do are, a gui for the freedb results, so one can change the results gathered from the freedb to suits his needs, fixing some bugs I encounter :), and maybe for the next release a file renamer based on id3tag with custom pattern renaming...
